<h3>Learning Log</h3>
<p>The learning log allows you to maintain a simple log of your activities. It allows recording of the start date, end date (if appropriate), title, location (physical or virtual) and description of the CPD activity together with the time spent (hours). Also, a rolling total of time spent on CPD is calculated.</p>
<p>Multiple logs may be created. So, you could create a new one for each academic year or for a particular programme of study.</p>
<p>You could add a log to a Portfolio Page together with relevant resources and artefacts. For example: reflective journals, notes, mind maps, presentations, links, images, multimedia clips, digital certificates and badges.</p>
<p>You could share these logs containing Pages with colleagues, tutors, line-managers etc.</p>
