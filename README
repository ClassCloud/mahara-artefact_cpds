Plugin for adding a Learning Log to Mahara

This Mahara plugin allows a simple log of learning activities to be maintained. It includes fields for the start date, end date (if appropriate) title, location and description of the CPD acitivity together with the time spent (hours). Also, a rolling total of time spent on CPD is calculated.

This can be added to a Mahara view which can also include related resources and artefacts e.g. a blog reflecting in more detail on particular aspects of the CPD. 

The plugin allows a user to have multiple instances of learning logs. So, a user can start a new log for each academic year or have a dedicated CPD for a particular programme of study. 

The plugin adds a new 'Learning Log', similar to 'Plans'('My Plans') to 'Portfolio' ('My Portfolio') in Mahara. Indeed, the code was based on Mahara 'Plans' and was initially developed by James Kerrigan, one of the students on the Foundation degree in Computing and Internet Technology at the University Centre Yeovil.

It is possible to export a Page, or Pages, containing a learning log, as HTML pages. 

It is also possible to import/export a learning log using the Leap2A format allowing transfer between different Mahara installations or other Leap2A compliant ePortfolio systems.

Download from the master branch (for the latest version), unpack and copy the /cpds folder (and included files and folders) into the /artefact folder of your Mahara installation. 

Then enable the plugin type: artefact cpds, followed by the plugin type: blocktype cpds/cpds from the Plugin Administration interface.

The plugin has will work with any Mahara 18.10+ installation. It creates a new artefact_cpds_activity table which is a 1:1 extension of the artefact table. 

Please test it on a development installation before production deployment.

Enjoy
